## WHAT IS AN OPEN PAPER PROJECT?

Open-Paper-Project is a project that we writing paper like the developing open source project, which I believe I'm the first person who decides to write a paper like this, is a project that:

1. Written in MarkDown on GitHub, like this: [A Mini Review of Word Embedding in Morpho](https://github.com/zixia/paper-morpho-vector-presentation)
1. Open for the new researcher who is interested in the paper topic to join
1. Open for Pull Requests from the community, to add his opinions to the paper
1. List all contributors(who's PR had been accepted) as the authors of the paper

### Inherited from Open Source Project

Yes, it's inherited from the concepts of "Open Source Project"

I had become an Open Source fan after I was able to use the Internet at Tsinghua University since 1997.

An Open Source Project is powerful, such as the Linux Kernel, which is built from the community.

There's also some project called an "OPEN Open Source Project", like the [Level Community](https://github.com/Level/community/blob/ff67b1c2ee90e02c352cc2fd797c3b80ac183178/CONTRIBUTING.md)
